          Moyo is setting out to be the world’s leading accessible financial education platform, with emphasis on accessible. As such, personality is by necessity at the heart of the Moyo brand.
          <br>
          <br>The financial world can be effectively characterized as a black box for those not already inducted; but the primary tenet behind the Moyo model and, by extension, its brand identity, is “It doesn’t have to be.”
          <br>
          <br>The greatest pain point hindering the financial empowerment of the vast majority of today’s generations is barrier to entry to financial education--including financial self-education. The cause of the pedagogical bottleneck comes down to an inappropriately-scaling degree of variable complexity. To put it in simpler terms--in Moyo’s terms--the learning curve scales too quickly.
          <br>
          <br>The solution? Storytelling

        >The Moyo approach is to use storytelling as a platform for approachable financial education. A story is at its core a controlled and directed sandbox of events and of forces intended to communicate a limited set of central ideas. To adapt the storytelling matrix for Moyo’s purposes, financial knowledge and the principles of wealth accrual are isolated to their very foundational levels, and communicated in focused, clear, objective-based learning delivery, followed up by the risk-free application of those principles in controlled sandbox trading environments with the goal of reinforcement of actionable insights (and only actionable insights).</p>

        >In other words, goal- and scenario-based risk-free trading with tightly controlled (and more importantly, deliberately limited) unexpected variables will allow learners to walk away educated and empowered. This risklessness is essential in an ecosystem of industry-driven financial education which exclusively serves to funnel users into financial products (such as brokerage accounts) which necessitate real-world risk.</p>

          The goal of any real-life interpersonal relationship is to connect; to exchange anecdotes, ideas, likes and dislikes, hardships, and empathy. This rule doesn’t change in business, nor in education. As human beings, we’re hardwired for stories and dialogues.
          <br>
          <br>In an era of MOOCs (massively open online courses) and shifting paradigms in formal education, new frontiers in accessible adult learning and professional development are constantly being pushed. While the MOOC format has largely democratized access to advanced learning resources, they often fail to resonate with students and audiences.

          Those which succeed (based purely on the metric of content provided, not considerations such as cost, software, etc.), tend to do so on the merits of a distinct and recognizable content provider--a unique face and voice serving as the locus of authority and credibility.
          <br>
          <br>For third-party content aggregate MOOC providers, such as Udemy or Coursera, there is no unifying story across learning modules. Content providers are responsible for converting and retaining their users and followers, while the platforms are more akin to brokers, bringing user and provider together.
          <br>
          <br>Moyo needs to be more. While Moyo will thrive on a robust content-provider ecosystem, that content must never be so platform-independent so as to break the user immersion of their story and dialogue with the platform itself.

      AirBnB succeeds on telling the stories of experiences, shaped by the places its users visit. Goodlife Fitness succeeds by telling the stories of everyday fitness heroes, rather than those of hyper-sculpted stock-photo models. Warby Parker succeeds by telling the story of every individual pair of glasses, socially-consciously manufactured using plant-based materials, polished by hand, and often contributed en masse to charitable partners throughout the globe.

      <br>Moyo doesn’t have the physical or locational product stories of these brands (although some day, it might). What it does have is the story of its target users and the story of the problem it seeks to solve.

          Using unique, original characters, with their own stories, their own journeys, and their own evolutions.
          <br>
          <br>More than brand ambassadors, Moyo’s character avatars will serve as loci of appeal and empathy, through which they can connect with the brand.
          <br>
          <br>The most important consideration in achieving this will be toeing the balance between character appeal and authenticity. It’s no secret that these characters and their stories are fictional and heavily stylized, but their story and their experiences will ring true to users for fostering those empathetic connections, while sustaining the appropriate degree of suspension of disbelief to facilitate users’ willful and enthusiastic buy-in.

          Moyo’s focus is opening access to quality financial education and resources to everyone. As a result, inclusion and diversity are key values, represented across the Moyo brand. This includes diversity of all kinds, not just financial or socioeconomic.
          <br>
          <br>Our character product ambassadors, just like our future users, are representative of diversity across the spectrum. They embody the guidelines which set the tone for Moyo’s identity. They exist to do more than simply delight or even to inform our users and audience. They exist to be related to, to be welcoming, to be paragons of positivity who celebrate differences and the break-down of the traditional archetypes representing financial success.
        </p>
          <p class="p-5 d-flex align-self-center">
          Our characters come from all backgrounds, all ages, all races, all creeds; they carry their own goals and dreams; they bring with them their own fears; they reflect all of our users, anybody aiming to achieve financial independence and security. They reflect everyone, full stop.
          <br>
          <br>Moyo is for everyone, full stop.
